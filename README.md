Topic
During requirements modeling, systems developers must identify and describe all system requirements. 

In engineering, a requirement is a singular documented need of what a particular product or service will be or perform. It is a statement that identifies a necessary attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of a system in order for it to have value and utility to a user.  

Requirements are used as inputs into the Design phase of technology product development. Requirements are an important input into the verification process since tests are required to trace back to specific requirements.  

Fact-finding (gathering information) involves answering 5 questions: Who, What, Where, When and How.    The common fact-finding techniques are interviews, document review, observation, sampling, research, surveys, and questionnaires.

A collection of requirements defines the characteristics or features of the desired system.   A 'good' list of requirements avoids saying HOW the system will implement the requirements, leaving such decisions to the system designer.  Describing how the system will be implemented may be known as "implementation bias" or "solution engineering". 

Your technology solution will  major Functions that can be completed by the user.  For example, an online banking application provides the user to deposit checks, transfer money from one account to another,  check balance, and open a new account.   

Each function requires business requirements that must be met for the function to work according to the user's expectations.   

Requirements DO/DO NOT
Define one requirement at a time;  each requirement is atomic. 
Do not use conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so, also).  
Each requirement is required to be measurable.  Can a tester be able to determine that the requirement was met?   
Do not use let-out clauses:  like, except, if necessary.
Each requirement must form a complete sentence with no buzzwords, slang,  or acronyms.
Each requirement must contain a subject (user/system) and a predicate (intended result, action or condition).
Do not describe how the system will do something. Only discuss what the system will do. Refrain from system design. Normally, if you catch yourself mentioning field names, programming language, and software objects in the Requirements Document, you are not thinking in User Story (user experience).
Do not use indefinable terms like user-friendly, versatile, robust, approximately, minimal impact, etc. Such terms often mean different things to different people, making it difficult to define their test cases.
Do not have duplication and contradictory statements.
Do not express suggestions or possibilities. Do not use: might, may, could, ought, shall
Use positive statements such as “The system will…”, instead of “The system will not…” 
Company Information
Scope Change
The scope has decreased because of business priority changes.  The following have been removed:  Asset Stages, Reporting Dashboard,  and two process (Support and  Retire).  Plus, the CSO has reminded the project team that the system must have security requirements.   

The following 2 business functions will be done:  Serialized Asset Tracking and Stockroom Management which will have a user interface that will answer the use case questions, and to support the following processes:  

 Asset Entry Process    
 User Request Process  
 Fulfillment Process
